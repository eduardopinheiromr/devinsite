# **How to quickstart development**

Inside the directory, run in terminal only once\*:

    yarn setup && yarn dev

\*yarn setup will delete the .git folder, so you should run it only once. After this, run only yarn dev to start the development server.

Then, open in your browser http://localhost:3000/
